# Why This Tool Was Created

## The Problem

Like many investors, I wanted to keep track of my Vanguard fund prices regularly. However, checking these prices was becoming a daily hassle because:

- **Manual checking required**: I had to log into my Vanguard account every day just to see current prices
- **No convenient way to monitor**: Vanguard doesn't offer email alerts or push notifications for price updates
- **Time-consuming process**: Logging in, navigating to the right pages, and checking multiple funds took valuable time each day

## The Solution

This tool solves the problem by:

- **Automated monitoring**: Automatically checks your Vanguard fund prices without you having to log in
- **Instant notifications**: Sends you push notifications directly to your phone when prices are updated
- **Saves time**: No more manual checking - get your price updates delivered to you
- **Simple setup**: Once configured, it runs automatically in the background

## How It Helps You

Instead of spending time every day logging into Vanguard's website to check prices, you'll receive automatic notifications with your fund information. This gives you the convenience of staying informed about your investments without the daily hassle of manual checking.

**Perfect for**: Busy investors who want to stay updated on their Vanguard funds without the daily login routine.
