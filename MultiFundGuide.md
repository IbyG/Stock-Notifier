# Multi-Fund Configuration Guide

## Overview

The Vanguard Stock Notifier has been updated to support multiple funds with separate NTFY notifications for each fund.

## Configuration File

The scraper now reads fund configurations from `funds_config.yml`. This file contains:

- **Fund names**: Human-readable names for each fund
- **URLs**: Direct links to each fund's price page
- **Port IDs**: Vanguard's internal fund identifiers

## Adding New Funds

To add a new fund to monitor:

1. Open `funds_config.yml`
2. Add a new entry under the `funds:` section:

```yaml
funds:
  - name: "Your Fund Name"
    url: "https://www.vanguard.com.au/personal/invest-with-us/fund?portId=XXXX&tab=prices-and-distributions"
    port_id: "XXXX"
```

3. Replace `XXXX` with the actual port ID from Vanguard's website

## NTFY Notifications

Each fund now sends separate NTFY notifications with:

- **Fund-specific titles**: Each notification includes the fund name
- **Individual messages**: Price updates are sent per fund
- **Error handling**: Errors are also fund-specific

## Running the Scraper

The scraper will now:

1. Load all configured funds from `funds_config.yml`
2. Process each fund sequentially
3. Send separate NTFY notifications for each fund
4. Provide a summary of successful/failed scrapes
